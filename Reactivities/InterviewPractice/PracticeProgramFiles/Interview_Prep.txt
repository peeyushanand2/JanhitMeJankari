IEnumerable
	IEnumerable exists in System.Collections Namespace.
	IEnumerable can move forward only over a collection, it can’t move backward and between the items.
	IEnumerable is best to query data from in-memory collections like List, Array, etc.
	While query data from a database, IEnumerable execute a select query on the server side, load data in-memory on a client-side and then filter data.
	IEnumerable is suitable for LINQ to Object and LINQ to XML queries.
	MyDataContext dc = new MyDataContext ();
	IEnumerable<Employee> list = dc.Employees.Where(p => p.Name.StartsWith("S"));
	list = list.Take<Employee>(10);

IQueryable
	IQueryable exists in System. Linq Namespace.
	While query data from a database, IQueryable execute the select query on the server side with all filters.
	 MyDataContext dc = new MyDataContext ();
	IQueryable<Employee> list = dc.Employees.Where(p => p.Name.StartsWith("S"));
	list = list.Take<Employee>(10);
	
Tuple?
	The Tuple<T> class was introduced in .NET Framework 4.0. A tuple is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements of different data types. 
	It can be used where you want to have a data structure to hold an object with properties, but you don't want to create a separate type for it.
	Tuple<int, string, string> person = 
                        new Tuple <int, string, string>(1, "Steve", "Jobs");
	var person = Tuple.Create(1, "Steve", "Jobs");
	
	Accessing Tuple Elements
	person.Item1; // returns 1
	person.Item2; // returns "Steve"
	person.Item3; // returns "Jobs"

	Tuples can be used in the following scenarios:
	When you want to return multiple values from a method without using ref or out parameters.
	When you want to pass multiple values to a method through a single parameter.
	When you want to hold a database record or some values temporarily without creating a separate class.

	Tuple Limitations:
	The Tuple is a reference type and not a value type. It allocates on heap and could result in CPU intensive operations.
	The Tuple is limited to include eight elements. You need to use nested tuples if you need to store more elements. However, this may result in ambiguity.
	The Tuple elements can be accessed using properties with a name pattern Item<elementNumber>, which does not make sense.

EVENTS?

	Events are nothing just a user action.

	HOW EVENTS WORK WITH DELEGATES?
	Delegates are used to reference a method. An Event is associated with Event Handler using Delegates. 
	When an Event raise, it sends a signal to delegates and delegates executes the right function.

	WHAT IS PUBLISHER-SUBSCRIBER MODEL?
	There are two parts in any event handling program. One part is Publisher that contains definition of events and delegates 
	and another part is Subscriber that accepts the event and provides an event handler.

	public delegate void Notify();  // delegate
                    
	public class ProcessBusinessLogic
	{
    	 public event Notify ProcessCompleted; // event
	}

	In the above example, we declared a delegate Notify and then declared an event ProcessCompleted of delegate type Notify using "event" keyword 
	in the ProcessBusinessLogic class. Thus, the ProcessBusinessLogic class is called the publisher. The Notify delegate specifies the signature for 
	the ProcessCompleted event handler. It specifies that the event handler method in subscriber class must have a void return type and no parameters.

	Now, let's see how to raise the ProcessCompleted event. Consider the following implementation.

	Example: Raising an Event

	public delegate void Notify();  // delegate
                    
	public class ProcessBusinessLogic
	{
    	public event Notify ProcessCompleted; // event

    	public void StartProcess()
    	{
        Console.WriteLine("Process Started!");
        // some code here..
        OnProcessCompleted();
    	}

    	protected virtual void OnProcessCompleted() //protected virtual method
    	{
        //if ProcessCompleted is not null then call delegate
        ProcessCompleted?.Invoke(); 
    	}
	}

	Example: Consume an Event

	class Program
	{
    	public static void Main()
    	{
        ProcessBusinessLogic bl = new ProcessBusinessLogic();
        bl.ProcessCompleted += bl_ProcessCompleted; // register with an event
        bl.StartProcess();
    	}

   	 // event handler
    	public static void bl_ProcessCompleted()
    	{
        Console.WriteLine("Process Completed!");
    	}
	}
	

Delegate?

	A delegate is an object which refers to a method or you can say it is a reference type variable that can hold a reference to the methods. 
	Delegates in C# are similar to the function pointer in C/C++. It provides a way which tells which method is to be called when an event is triggered.
	
	class Geeks {
	public delegate void addnum(int a, int b);
	public delegate void subnum(int a, int b);
	public void sum(int a, int b) { Console.WriteLine("(100 + 40) = {0}", a + b); }
	public void subtract(int a, int b){ Console.WriteLine("(100 - 60) = {0}", a - b); }
	public static void Main(String []args){
	Geeks obj = new Geeks();
	addnum del_obj1 = new addnum(obj.sum);
    	subnum del_obj2 = new subnum(obj.subtract);
	// pass the values to the methods by delegate object
    	del_obj1(100, 40);
    	del_obj2(100, 60);
	// These can be written as using
    	// "Invoke" method
    	// del_obj1.Invoke(100, 40);
    	// del_obj2.Invoke(100, 60);
	}
	}

WCF
---
WCF?
	WCF stands for Windows Communication Foundation. It is basically used to create a distributed and interoperable Application. 
	WCF Applications came into the picture in .Net 3.0 Framework. This is a framework, which is used for creating Service oriented Applications.
	
ABCs of WCF?
	In WCF to define an endpoint ABC is required to establish the communication.
	A stands for Address, B stands for Binding and the C stands for Contract.

	Address:
	https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://OnlineShoppingServer.com:8001/Service__;!!F_S_FTKmJFE!27UfLVmBsH60SPBa13433nRqSf4jYM375CxVoxf_bWdATxL6b7U5q1V0EzZgCQtMapB56U4uI0BvJl3yFsjokFGDlb11$ 
	HTTP is the transport schema
	OnlineShoppingServer.com is the server location
	8001 is PORT number where the server is listening for incoming requests.
 	Service is the relative location of the resource on the server.

	HTTP : It's a protocol for communication over the web (uses TCP at a lower level).
	TCP : High performance communication in WCF. Good for intranet scenarios.
	Named Pipe : Fast and reliable communication between client and server running on the same machine.
	MSMQ : Used when the client enqueues a message that a service can then consume later.

	Binding:
	It is about how the messages are handled in the service side and the client side. Binding is a group of elements that correspond to the transport 
	and protocol channels located in the channel stack. The channel stack is the sequence of channels that each passes through to the runtime execution. 
	
	Transport Channel: it is responsible for transporting messages from the client to the server using the transport protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, TCP, 
	Named Pipes or MSMQ. The main responsibility is message encoding and transport.
	
	Protocol Channel: The protocol channel contains protocols like Security Protocol, Reliable Messaging and Transaction Protocol. 
	Responsible for providing security features like authorization, authentication, protection and confidentiality.
	
	Protocol Channel
	Security Protocol
	Reliable Messaging
	Transaction Protocol

	Contract: Agreement 
	The contract is an agreement between the client and the server about the structure and content of messages being exchanged. 
	The Data Contract is about the structure of the message, whereas the message contract is about the content of the message being exchanged.

	Service contracts : Service contracts define the Interface for the service.
	Operation Contract : An Operation Contract defines the method exposed to the client to exchange the information between the client and server.
	Data Contract : Data Contracts define the data type for variables that are the same as get and set properties but the difference is that a Data Contract 
			in WCF is used to serialize and deserialize the complex data. It defines how data types are serialized and deserialized. 
			Using serialization, you can convert an object into a sequence of bytes that can be transmitted over a network. Using de-serialization, 
			you reassemble an object from a sequence of bytes that you receive from a calling application.
	Message contracts : The default SOAP message format is provided by the WCF runtime for communication between the client and the service.
	Fault Contract : A Fault Contract handles the exception and understands the cause of the error that occurs in the WCF service.

What are the various ways of hosting a WCF service?

	There are four ways of hosting a WCF service.
	Self-Hosting
	Windows services hosting
	IIS hosting
	Windows Activation Services hosting (WAS)

What are the different types of bindings in WCF?
	Basic binding
	Web binding
	Web Service (WS) binding
	WS Dual binding
	TCP binding
	IPC binding
	MSMQ bindingFederated WS binding
	Peer Network binding
	MSMQ integration binding

What are the ways to create a WCF Client?
	There are two ways to create a WCF Client or calling a WCF Service as:
	WCF Proxy
	Channel factory

What is Instance Management in WCF?
	WCF manages the session by creating the instance of the service class. This created instance(s) handle the incoming service request. 
	In WCF, the session is the way of managing the services instance(s) so that the server can use these instances in an optimized way. 
	At the server side, the InstanceContext class is used to manage service class instance. There are following instance management ways :

	Per Call
	Per Session
	Single

What is Concurrency Management in WCF?
	Concurrency management is closely related to the Instance management in WCF but both are two different things. 
	Instance management specifies how the service instances are created while Concurrency management specifies how many concurrent requests 
	are handled by the service instances. By using concurrency, you can make your service instance thread-safe. 
	By default, a per-call service instance is thread-safe since each request is served by a new service instance. 
	A per-session service instance is not thread-safe since multiple requests of a client are served by a single service instance. 
	Hence, it’s required concurrency management. A single service instance is not thread-safe since multiple requests of all clients 
	are served by a single service instance. Hence, it’s required concurrency management.
	
What is Impersonation?
	Impersonation is a way to authorize a caller (client) identity to access the service domain’s resources. 
	The service resources may be local files or database tables and should be on the same machine on which service is hosted. 
	By default, impersonation is disabled and resources are accessed by using the WCF service's process identity.

What is WCF Data Service?
	WCF Data Services uses OData (Open Data Protocol) protocol for querying or manipulating the data. WCF Data Services is built on top of WCF REST Services. 
	It is a RESTful service to support CRUD operations on the database using the HTTP protocol. It supports all database operations using URI. 
	DATA protocol can expose data from the relational database, File systems, Web sites, services etc. It supports XML or JSON format for exposing the data.
---
SQL
---

	executeQuery(): This method is used to execute statements that returns tabular data (example select). It returns an object of the class ResultSet.
	ExecuteNonQuery:  Executes Insert, Update, and Delete statements (DML statements) and returns the number of rows affected.
	
	ExecuteReader: Executes the SQL query (Select statement) and returns a Reader object which can perform a forward only traversal across the set of records being fetched.
	ExecuteScalar(): ExecuteScalar is a method of SQLCommand that Executes the query, and returns the first column of the first row of the result set returned by the query.

	DataReader is used to read the data from the database and it is a read and forward only connection oriented architecture during fetch the data from database.
	DataReader will fetch the data very fast when compared with dataset. Generally, we will use ExecuteReader object to bind data to datareader.

	DataSet is a disconnected orient architecture that means there is no need of active connections during work with datasets and it is a collection of DataTables
	and relations between tables. It is used to hold multiple tables with data. You can select data form tables, create views based on table 
	and ask child rows over relations. Also DataSet provides you with rich features like saving data as XML and loading XML data.

	DataAdapter will acts as a Bridge between DataSet and database. This dataadapter object is used to read the data from database and bind that data to dataset.
	Dataadapter is a disconnected oriented architecture.

	DataTable represents a single table in the database. It has rows and columns. There is no much difference between dataset and datatable, 
	dataset is simply the collection of datatables. 

Which is faster DataSet or DataReader?
	DataReader is a stream which is readonly and forward only. DataReader releasese the records as query executes and do not wait for the entire query to execute. 
	Therefore it is very fast as compare to the dataset. It releases only when read method is called.

ASP.NET Core
------------

Describe the ASP.NET Core?

	ASP.NET Core is an open-source and cross-platform that allows you to build modern, Internet-connected and cloud enabled applications.

	With ASP.NET Core you can
	build web applications, IoT (Internet of things) apps, services and mobile Backends.
	run on .Net Core.
	You can do your development on Linux, Windows and MacOS.
	deploy your code to cloud or on-premises

What is the role of Startup class?

	Startup class is responsible for configuration related things as below.
		It configures the services which are required by the app.
		It defines the app's request handling pipeline as a series of middleware components.

	// Startup class example
	public class Startup 
	{
    	public Startup(IConfiguration configuration){ Configuration = configuration; }
    	public IConfiguration Configuration { get; }

    	public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services) { services.AddRazorPages(); }

    	public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env)
    	{
        if (env.IsDevelopment())
        {
            app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
        }
        else
        {
            app.UseExceptionHandler("/Error");
            app.UseHsts();
        }

        app.UseHttpsRedirection();
        // other middleware components
   	 }
	}
	Startup class is specified inside the 'CreateHostBuilder' method when the host is created.
	Multiple Startup classes can also be defined for different environments, At run time appropriate startup class is used.

What is the role of ConfigureServices and Configure method?

	ConfigureServices method is optional and defined inside startup class.It gets called by the host before the 'Configure' method to configure the app's services.
	Configure method is used to add middleware components to the IApplicationBuilder instance that's available in Configure method.
	Configure method also specifies how the app responds to HTTP request and response. ApplicationBuilder instance's 'Use...' 
	extension method is used to add one or more middleware components to request pipeline.

	You can configure the services and middleware components without the Startup class and it's methods, by defining this configuration inside the 
	Program class in CreateHostBuilder method.

 Describe the Dependency Injection ?

	Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle. It is used to invert different kinds of controls in object-oriented design to achieve loose coupling.
	Dependency Injection is a Design Pattern that's used as a technique to achieve the Inversion of Control (IoC) between the classes and their dependencies.
	
	ASP.NET Core comes with a built-in Dependency Injection framework that makes configured services available throughout the application. 
	You can configure the services inside the ConfigureServices method as below. services.AddScoped();

	DI framework solves these problems as below.
	Use Interfaces or base class to abstract the dependency implementation.
	Dependencies are registered in the Service Container provided by ASP.NET Core inside Startup class 'ConfigureServices' method.
	Dependencies are injected using constructor injection and the instance is created by DI and destroyed when no longer needed.

	But these direct dependencies can be problematic for the following reasons.
	If you want to replace 'MyDependency' with a different implementation then the class must be modified.
	It's difficult to Unit Test.
	If MyDependency class has dependencies then it must be configured by class. If Multiple classes have dependency on 'MyDependency', the code becomes scattered.
	Public class A {
	MyDependency dep = new MyDependency();

	public void Test(){
	dep.SomeMethod();
	 }
	}

Describe the Service Lifetimes ?

	Transient - Services with transient lifetime are created each time they are requested from service container. 
	So it's best suited for stateless, light weight services.
	Scoped - Services with scoped lifetime are created once per connection or client request. When using scoped service in middleware then inject the service 
	via invoke or invokeAsync method. You should not inject the service via constructor injection as it treats the service behavior like Singleton.
	Singleton - Service with singleton lifetime is created once when first time the service is requested. 
	For subsequent requests same instance is served by service container.

Explain the Middleware in ASP.NET Core ?

	The Request handling pipeline is a sequence of middleware components where each component performs the operation on 
	and either call the next middleware component or terminate the request. When a middleware component terminates the request,
	it's called Terminal Middleware as It prevents next middleware from processing the request.You can add a middleware component 
	to the pipeline by calling .Use... extension method as below.

	 app.UseHttpsRedirection();
     	 app.UseStaticFiles();
   	 app.UseRouting();

What is Request delegate?

	Request delegates handle each HTTP request and are used to build request pipeline. It can configured using Run, Map and Use extension methods. 
	An request delegate can be a in-line as an anonymous method (called in-line middleware) or a reusable class. These classes or in-line methods
	are called middleware components.	
	
What is Host in ASP.NET Core?

	Host encapsulates all the resources for the app. On startup, ASP.NET Core application creates the host. The Resources which are encapsulated 
	by the host include:

	HTTP Server implementation
	Dependency Injection
	Configuration
	Logging
	Middleware components

ASP.NET MVC Scaffolding?

	Scaffolding is a technique used by MVC to generate code for basic CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations against database effectively.	
	Scaffolding consists of page templates, entity page templates, field page templates, and filter templates. These templates are called Scaffold templates 
	and allow you to quickly build a functional data-driven Website.

Manage Session In MVC?

	ASP.NET MVC provides three ways (TempData, ViewData and ViewBag) to manage sessions, apart from that we can use session variable, hidden fields 
	and HTML controls for doing it.

	TempData
	TempData in ASP.NET MVC is basically a dictionary object derived from TempDataDictionary.
	TempData internally uses session variable and stays for a subsequent HTTP Request. This means it maintains data when you move one controller to 
	another controller or one action to another action. As this is a dictionary object null checking and typecasting is required while using it.
	TempData["Name"] = "Kailash";
	string name = TempData["Name"].ToString();
	TempData gets destroyed immediately after it’s used (once value is read from tempdata) in subsequent HTTP request.
	
	ViewData
	ViewData maintains data when you move from controller to view. It is also a dictionary object and derived from ViewDataDictionary. 
	As Data is stored as Object in ViewData, while retrieving, the data it needs to be Type Casted to its original type as the data is stored as objects 
	and it also requires NULL checks while retrieving.
	ViewData["ViewDataName"] = "abc";
	string abc = ViewData["ViewDataName"].ToString();
	
	ViewBag
	The ViewBag is a dynamic type property of ControllerBase class which is the base class of all the controllers. 
	It’s a dynamic wrapper around ViewData casting is not required when you use ViewBag. ViewBag only transfers data from controller to view, 
	not visa-versa. ViewBag values will be null if redirection occurs.
	ViewBag.Name = "Kailash";
	string ViewBagname = ViewBag.Name;

View Vs Partial View?

	View
	View contains the layout page
	_viewstart page is rendered before any view is rendered
	View may have markup tags like html, body, head, title, meta etc.
	
	Partial View
	Partial view does not contain the layout page
	Partial view does not check for a _viewstart.cshtml. We cannot place any common code for a partial view within the _viewStart.cshtml page.
	The Partial view is specially designed to render within the view and as a result it does not contain any mark up.
	Partial view is more lightweight than the view. We can also pass a regular view to the RenderPartial method.
	If there is no layout page specified in the view, it can be considered as a partial view. In razor, there is no distinction between views 
	and partial views as in the ASPX view engine (aspx and ascx).
	
	Render Partial View Using jQuery
	<script type="text/jscript">  
        $('#partialView').load('/shared/PartialViewExample’);  
	</script> 

	HTML helper has two methods for rendering the partial view: Partial and RenderPartial.
	<div>  
    	@Html.Partial("PartialViewExample")  
	</div>  
	<div>  
    	@{  
        Html.RenderPartial("PartialViewExample");  
    	}  
	</div>

	The result of the RenderPartial method is written directly into the HTTP response, it means that this method used the same TextWriter object 
	as used by the current view. This method returns nothing.
	
	The Html.RenderPartial method writes output directly to the HTTP response stream so it is slightly faster than the Html.Partial method.

Media queries in angular?

	Using Media queries, now we can define styles that would be applied for different devices.
	Media queries give us the possibility to target various parameters including width and height (both with min and max prefixes), orientation, 
	type of presentation (screen, reader, print), available colours, aspect ratio, resolution, availability of JavaScript parser etc.

	@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  	header nav {
    		display: none;
  	}
	}
	@media screen and (orientation: landscape) {
  	header nav {
    	position: fixed;
   	left: 0;
    	width: 20vw;
  	}
	}	
	Header navigation would be rendered in a block. Unless the screen was smaller than 769px (typical mobile resolution), in which case it would hidden. 
	Unless, the screen is in landscape mode (width greater than height), in which case it would be fixed on the left and take 20% of the viewport's width.

Right Triangle Star Pattern Program in C#?

Display the pattern like a pyramid?

	int i,j,n;
	n= Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine());    
   	for(i=0;i<n;i++)
   	{
     	for(j=1;j<=n-i;j++)
     	Console.Write(" ");
     	for(j=1;j<=2*i-1;j++)
       	Console.Write("*");
     	Console.Write("\n");
   	}
